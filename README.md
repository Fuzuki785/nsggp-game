# Not-so-generic Generic Platformer

A simple game skeleton built with the [Phaser](phaser.io) WebGL game engine and the
[Electron Framework](electronjs.org) for window management, enabling the use of [NodeJS](nodejs.org) for filesystem
access.


## Working from source
### Setup

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

### Structure

- **`src/`**
  - **`data/`**
      - **`scenes/`** : Level description files
        - `1.json` : Simple (and only) level using all currently implemented features.
        - `test.json` : Test level, was used for testing, not accessible through normal gameplay.
      - **`settings/`** : Settings files
        - `inputs.json` : Inputs settings, list of keybindings for each implemented action.
  - `game.js` : Game logic.
  - `index.html` : HTML rendered by Electron.
  - `index.css` : CSS rules used on `index.html`.
  - `index.js` : Electron logic (generated by [Electron-Forge](electronforge.io)).
- **`out/`** (excluded from git) : Exports from `npm run package`

### Building

Run `npm run package` to build all the outputs (no signing key).


**Note:** Will look into restricting which outputs are generated from `electron-packager`, just struggling with the
syntax and parameters.
